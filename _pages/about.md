I am a [Post-doctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hkubs.hku.hk/people/shuo-li/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Economics from Peking University in 2022.

I am interested in environmental economics, health economics, development economics, and green finance/ESG. My research topics encompass environmental risks (for example, climate change, water pollution and air pollution), environmental policy, and public health (for example, environmental health, nutrition).
